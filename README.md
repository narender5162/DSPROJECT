** **TOUISM DESTINATIONS PROJECT** 
**Summary******
This project showcases a detailed analysis and clustering of tourism destinations in Europe, utilizing a well-organized and methodical approach. It uses data science and machine learning methods to find insights, predict trends, and offer actionable recommendations for stakeholders. The dataset has a bunch of detailed info about tourism destinations, like how many tourists visit each year, popular foods, living costs, and the ideal times to go there.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Converted and processed text data into numerical formats.
I used imputation techniques to deal with missing values.
Using StandardScaler to standardize features for clustering.
**Analyzing and Visualizing Data:**

I've figured out the top 10 places and countries that attract the most tourists.
I created a visual representation of the cost of living distribution, country distribution, and popular foods for each destination.
I looked into the trends regarding the "best time to visit" for different destinations.

**Clustering Models:**

K-Means Clustering: We can find the best number of clusters by using the Elbow Method.
Hierarchical Clustering: I grouped destinations by using a dendrogram and Agglomerative Clustering.
DBSCAN helps in finding dense clusters and also takes into account noise points, all while allowing for adjustable parameters.


**Assessment Criteria:**

I compared clustering models using metrics like the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.
The results are shown using clear and easy-to-understand graphs.
Results:

Cluster profiles for DBSCAN have been saved.
I made a list of the top 10 countries to visit, highlighting their famous foods and the best times to go.
